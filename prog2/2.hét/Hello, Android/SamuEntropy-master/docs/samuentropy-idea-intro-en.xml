    <title>Introduction</title>
    <partintro>
        <para>First of all, we present the original idea, emphasizing its interdisciplinar (e.g. esport, artificial intelligence, pedagogy, psychology, history and informatics) aspect. Then, we unfold the idea in two directions, in an expectable one, which everyone would naturally think of, and in a less implicit direction, where the game is not the (only) goal of the esport to be developed, but the intention to join the research of artificial intelligence, where the esport is not simply using the AI, but it tries to create a new quality of AI.

		We outline the original idea and its implicit realization. In this document, we widen the concept of the original idea and we define it not only as an esport game, but we also outline it as a nontrivial realization, as a main part of our research plan.

                        <para>The questions regarding the target audience are important on their own, but could their examination be profitable regarding the support of professional players? The research of the extreme strain of the professional players, the support (for example classical physiological) of the players could be a natural goal. Examining mass sport (and its thought or real &#x201E;you always stare at the monitor&#x201D;  abuse) is interesting, too.

                    In this case – at least in our research – we can bravely try to &#x201D;redeem the world&#x201D;. For this, let us examine first, why we like playing games and can we develop artificial intelligence with an esport game. In other words, we define artificial intelligence neither as the controlling process of the player nor as the control of the gameplay, but as the creation of a new intelligent lifeform. Now, this is an entirely intuitive goal, so let the lifeform to be created mean anything for now.</para>

                    <para>
                        In the meantime, let the goal of the game be to enhance Samu's (in other worlds the &#x201D;developmental robotical learning machine &#x201D;) vision and hearing.<footnote>
                            <para>Only in an intuitive manner can we mention our reasearches regarding this topic.
                                For example for “vision”: <link xlink:href="https://github.com/nbatfai/SamuCam">https://github.com/nbatfai/SamuCam</link>, 
                                and for “hearing”: <link xlink:href="https://github.com/nbatfai/SamuVocab">https://github.com/nbatfai/SamuVocab</link>.</para>

                        Inventing the part that increases organization is difficult because it depends on the first point of the previous point.                                                                
                        (&#x201D;Let us give the modell of the machine that knows how to increase its inner organization&#x201D;), which is a big scientific challange… so we can make intuitive definitions at best:

                                If the definition of the &#x201D;entropy decreasing machine&#x201D; in question were similar to the definition of the Turing machine, then we could visualize the definition analogically to the GoDNGoD game plan. (In the mentioned game, we breed types based on the Turing machine's definition, for example the “Breedi Turingi” or the “Turingus Tri Breedus”, see the Norbert Bátfai,
